# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
In this project, I have analyzed the Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and sales. The analysis focuses on occupation, age, product category, and state. The goal is to provide insights to the client on targeting the best customers based on their sales data and identifying areas to enhance sales.

1. Data cleaning and manipulation.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn libraries.
3. Identifying the target age group for customers across different occupations and states.
4. Determining the most selling products during Diwali for the client.
